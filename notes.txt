NODE TUTORIAL 
///////

node  js   is the run  environment  that runs   outside of the browser 
1 you dont have the access  to  browser  api  aka   no  dom  
2 server side apps 
3 versions 
4  common js   is  used not the  es6
5  but you can  access  network  system  and the operating   system
6 how do  we get  node to evaluate  our code ?  
                 :repl or  cli   


//////////GLOBAL :
in vanilla  you can work  with  the window object
global definition :   anywhere  in your  application  you access them

those  globals are   : 
    1  __dirname   -  path to current directory 
    2  __filename   -    fila name 
    3  require   -   function to  use  modules 
    4  module    -  info  about  current  module  or file  
    5   procces    -  info about the  env the porgramm is   being executed 

in  the file type the log(__dirname)  for example     
=  '  node filename.js '   in the terminal


also  we have setinterval  


////////////////////////   MODULES 
you do  execute   only one  file   but your code is splitted  in many files 
so for that you need the modules

in common   js every  file is the module 
modules  are encapsulated pieces of code

the idea  behind the object  that any  you  put into  global object
'module'  you can  access  from  anywhere in the porgramm


require()   -    means  import here the code from  wanted module
you  also  can  export many  objects by  putting them  all into  the object 


but the fucntion  is invoked  inside of the file than it becomes global even  if 
you dont export it 
it will  be executed if  you write require but you cant invoke it 
it  will be run  automatically


////////////////////////////BUILT IN   MODULES:
OS 
https
FS 
PATH 

fs module  is the 'file system'


const os  =  require('os')    ///  this is how do it without ./  in directory
